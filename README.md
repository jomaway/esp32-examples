Welcome to the ESP32 Tutorial repository! This collection of small, self-contained examples is designed to introduce and demonstrate fundamental principles of embedded systems using the ESP32 microcontroller.

Aimed at beginners, these tutorials use the familiar **Arduino framework**, making it easy to get started with microcontroller programming. Each example is straightforward and focuses on a specific concept or functionality.

You can build and upload the examples to an ESP32 development board using the **PlatformIO extension** for VS Code. For those without hardware, the projects can also be simulated using the **Wokwi extension** within VS Code.

## ðŸš€ Setup Instructions

Getting started is quick and easy! This project includes a preconfigured **VS Code workspace** to streamline the setup. Just follow the steps below:

### 1. **Install VS Code**

If you havenâ€™t already, download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

### 2. **Install Required Extensions**

Make sure the following extensions are installed in VS Code:

- [**PlatformIO IDE**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=platformio.platformio-ide) â€“ for building and uploading code to your ESP32.
- [**Wokwi for VS Code**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Wokwi.wokwi-vscode) â€“ for simulating projects without hardware.

> **Tip:** After opening the workspace, VS Code may prompt you to install any missing extensions.

### 3. **Open the Workspace**

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the included `esp32-tutorial.code-workspace` file in VS Code.

```bash
code esp32-tutorial.code-workspace
```

### 4. Run the Examples

- To *build and upload* to a physical ESP32 board, use the PlatformIO controls in the status bar or sidebar.
- To *simulate with wokwi* (requires account), _build_ the project and start the **Wokwi Simulator** by opening the `diagram.json` and click the play button.
